## 1. Changes

Please see the [Change Log](./CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1. Command: `Left Align`

![Left Align](./readme_extras/demo_left_align.gif)

### 2.2. Command: `Right Align`

![Right Align](./readme_extras/demo_right_align.gif)

1. Open a vscode text editor or jupyter notebook text cell
2. Place multiple selections or multiple cursors (eg by using by using
   `Alt+Left Click` or `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down Arrow` or other methods)
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command search
4. Search for:
   - `Align Left Selections by Adding Spaces` OR
   - `Align Right Selections by Adding Spaces`
5. Spaces will be added before each cursor such that all cursors are now
   vertically aligned
   - Note: Weird stuff happens if there are two cursors on the same line, but it
     doesn't break anything; You can use Ctrl+Z to undo.

### 2.3. Command: `Number Cursors from ...`

![Right Align](./readme_extras/demo_number_cursors.gif)

1. Open a vscode text editor or jupyter notebook text cell
2. place multiple selections or multiple cursors (eg by using by using
   `Alt+Left Click` or `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down Arrow` or other methods)
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command search
4. Search for
   - `Number Cursors from Zero` OR
   - `Number Cursors from One` OR
   - `Number Cursors from ...` OR
   - `Number Cursors from ... choosing steps`
5. Numbers will be inserted at each cursor
   - starting at `0` or `1` respectively or prompting for the starting number
     and step (increment number) respectively
   - *ordered in the same way that cursors were created*

### 2.4. Command: `Seek to Next Occurrence`

Prompts for a search string, then moves current selection(s) forwards to the
next occurrence, staying on the same line as the current selection(s) end.

*TODO: screencapture*

### 2.5. Command: `Expand to Next Occurrence`

Prompts for a search string, then expands current selection(s) forwards to
before the next occurrence of the search string, staying on the same line as the
current selection(s) end.

*TODO: screencapture*

### 2.6. Command: `Sticky Line Above` - `ctrl+K ctrl+shift+enter`

Similar to the built-in 'Line Above' command, but it brings the text after the
cursor along.

*TODO: screencapture*
